# Schedule Feature Status - 2025-10-21

## Current State
- **Status**: NOT WORKING
- **Issue**: handleAddSchedule function exists in code but is OUTSIDE component scope
- **Symptom**: Button onClick handler is null in browser, modal doesn't open

## What We've Tried (2+ hours)
1. Added schedule handlers multiple times
2. Removed duplicate state declarations
3. Tried to fix component scope by removing closing braces
4. Restored from multiple commits
5. Rebuilt and redeployed many times

## Root Cause
The schedule handler functions are defined OUTSIDE the RallyDetail component function, making them inaccessible to the JSX.

## What Works
- Database table `rally_schedule` created ✅
- Schedule state declarations exist ✅
- Schedule modal JSX exists ✅
- Schedule display rendering exists ✅
- Build succeeds ✅

## What Doesn't Work
- Button onClick doesn't trigger ❌
- Handlers are undefined in browser ❌

## Next Steps (when resuming)
1. Use browser Network tab to inspect actual compiled JavaScript
2. Find where RallyDetail component closes in compiled code
3. Move handlers INSIDE component properly
4. Test with simple console.log first before full functionality

## Files Modified
- `pages/rally-detail/[id].js` - Main file with issues
- Database: `rally_schedule` table created

## Git Tags
- `v1.0-stable-baseline` - Last known fully working state (before schedule)
- `schedule-work-in-progress` - Current state (handlers exist but broken)

## Commits to Reference
- `9332b9a` - "Add schedule handler functions" (but they're outside component)
- `1506c1d` - "Restore working rally detail page" (current HEAD)
